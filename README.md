## <a name="introduction">Introduction</a>

This repository contains the code of a simulator capable of generating random values and applying Normal, Uniform, Poisson, and Exponential distributions to them. The output of the simulation includes a Queue Analysis table, Server Utilization metrics, and a Gantt Chart. Additionally, it supports multi-server configurations and priority-based queueing, providing a comprehensive analysis of queue performance. The simulator also computes critical metrics like turnaround time, wait time, and idle time for detailed insights.

## <a name="features">Features</a>

👉 **Queue Analysis and Visualization**: The simulator provides a detailed breakdown of key metrics, such as arrival time, service time, start time, end time, turnaround time, and wait time for each simulation.

👉 **Server Utilization Calculation**: Automatically calculates the utilization time for each server, displaying it as a percentage for easy evaluation of performance.

👉 **Multi-Server Support**: The simulator can handle multiple servers, providing individual utilization metrics for each.

👉 **Priority-Based Queueing**: Supports priority-based task handling to analyze the impact of priority levels on queue performance.

👉 **Critical Metrics Computation**: Calculates important queue metrics like turnaround time, wait time, and system idle time for a comprehensive analysis.

👉 **User-Friendly Output**: Presents data in an easy-to-read table format, with clear visual representation of all computed metrics.

👉 **Customizable Simulation Runs**: Users can define the number of simulations to test various queue setups under different conditions.
